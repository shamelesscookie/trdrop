* [**Solved Issues**](https://github.com/cirquit/trdrop/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)

See the [**release page**](https://github.com/cirquit/trdrop/releases) for the Windows installer. Other distributions are on the roadmap (Linux, MacOS).

## Description

The main use of this software is to estimate the *"real"* framerate of **an uncompressed video**.

Usually, a dedicated [capture card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_capture) is employed to capture the video stream with a fixed framerate of a console. To estimate the real framerate of the console, we check for differences on a frame-by-frame basis and count the different frames. This results in the *"real"* **framerate**.

The same is done with the **frametime**, as we count the amount of time a single frame is shown.

We also try to detect [**frametears**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_tearing) and incorporate them into the framerate and frametime calculation.

Hence the name **tr** (short for tear) and a framerate **drop**.

## Features

* Comparisson of up to 3 videos in parallel
    - any resolution
    - any raw and *"real"* framerate
* Export as imagesequence in `.png` or `.jpg`
    - Supporting 16:9 export resolution
* **Framerate** estimation
    - Customizable plot visualization (`color` + `time`)
    - Customizable text overlay (`font` + `color` + `position`)
    - "Centered" plot also possible
* **Frametime** estimation
    - Customizable plot visualization (`color` + `time`)
* **Tear** detection
    - complementing tears don't change the framerate (configurable)
    - Visualization (`color`)
* CSV export
    - Framerate
    - Frametime
* Visual overlay export
* Difference frame export

See the [DEVELOPMENT_HISTORY.md](DEVELOPMENT_HISTORY.md) for gifs I made while developing the application.

We will provide a detailed explanation and showcase in the future.
